creating a RPN calculator.
Operations are performed as is standard for an RPN calculator: any input number is pushed onto an operand stack. 
Each operation is performed on operands which are popped from the operand stack.
The result, if any, is pushed onto the operand stack.
The operations to be supported by your calculator are:
‘q’ – quit
‘+’ – unsigned addition 
‘p’ – pop-and-print
‘d’ – duplicate
‘^’ - X*2^Y
‘v’ – X*2^(-Y)
‘n’ – number of '1' bits
